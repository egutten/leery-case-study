        <p>Dynamic social proof for B2B businesses</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>B2B businesses do not leverage dynamic forms of social proof as effectively as B2C businesses.</p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p class="comment">I came to this solution by researching and examining competitive social proof products. The most compelling to me was Proof, and it struck me how it was built only for B2C businesses. I thought of adding logos to Proof's message model by noticing that the typical B2B practice is to statically post logos on a homepage. That static posting not only discourages any updates to the group of logos, it also does not bring any particular attention to them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Concept</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Show Prospective customers only the most current social proof data through a pop-up message (the "Message"), which includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The most recent conversion event that took place (e.g. “Just signed-up for a trial”)</li>
                <li>How long ago the conversion event occurred (e.g. “2 seconds ago”)</li>
                <li>The logo of the customer involved in the social proof (to take advantage of a benefit particular to B2B businesses)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>Execution</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Offer third-party javascript that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Gathers a B2B business’ ("User’s") conversion data necessary to populate the Message (“Conversion Snippet”)</li>
                <li>Generates the Message on load of a User’s webpage (“Message Snippet”)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Overall Development Process</h3>
      <p class="comment">The development process was formed not only to help provide structure to a large-scope project, but also to simulate working with a bigger team.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Broad concept discussion</li>
        <li>Creation of User Flow and System Design (detailed below)</li>
        <li>Sprint planning based on user stores (Asana)</li>
        <li>Code review</li>
        <li>Code refactor</li>
        <li>Product testing</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>User Stories</h3>
      <p class="comment">Writing user stories helped me think through what I needed to do, as well as practice communicating my ideas in a commonly-understood format.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>As a User, I want to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be presented with a landing page for Leery that funnels me to the sign-in/log-in routes so it is easy for me to access the product.</li>
            <li>Be able to configure and preview the appearance of my Message during the sign-up flow so I can use Leery right away.</li>
            <li><p>While logged in to the Leery User App:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Access and be instructed how to use the pre-generated Snippets</li>
                <li>Edit my original Message and create new Message configurations</li>
              </ul>
                So I can control my Message content and won’t have to worry about losing Snippets.
            </li>
            <li>Easily load the Message Snippet and Conversion Snippet in my own codebase so Leery can function as described.</li>
            <li>The Message to include the most current conversion that took place, as well as the logo of the customer (“Customer”) involved so I can take advantage of the benefits of dynamic social proof.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>User Flows</h3>
      <p class="comment">The diagrams below show the full use cycle of Leery. The colored labels (e.g. "User App") refer to the various components of the product, which are described in more detail in the System Design section below.</p>
      <div class="user-flow">
        <img src="img/uf-step-1.svg" alt="">
        <img src="img/uf-step-2.svg" alt="">
        <img src="img/uf-step-3.svg" alt="">
      </div>
      <h3>System Design</h3>
      <p class="comment">Leery's components were dictated by the needs that naturally arose from the User Flow above. The database structure was designed to be simple enough for anyone to understand in conjunction with the product, as well as efficient enough to allow for table joins that would produce the necessary data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Leery Landing Page (Webflow)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Explains the product and links to the User App.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>User App (Node-React-Express)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>An app for B2B businesses to sign up for Leery and access the user portal.</li>
            <li>The user portal allows for the creation and editing of Messages, as well as continued access to Snippets.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>Widget (Node-React)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accessed through the Message Snippet, generates Messages.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>Conversion Assist (Javascript)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accessed through the Conversion Snippet, pulls Customer conversion data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>API (Node-Express)</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Connects to PostgreSQL database to store:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>User credentials</li>
                <li>User's conversion events</li>
                <li>Customer's conversion data</li>
                <li>Customer activity (e.g. User page visits, Messages viewed, number of conversions)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="deployment">Deployment</h3>
      <p class="comment">Deployment was a multi-step process that involved considering what AWS feature would be the most fitting for each component in the System Design. SSL certificates were added after achieving a basic push to production.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Leery Landing Page</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AWS S3 Bucket: https://getleery.com</li>
            <li>SSL achieved through Cloudfront</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>User App, Widget, Conversion Assist</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AWS S3 Bucket: https://app.getleery.com</li>
            <li>SSL achieved through Cloudfront</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>API</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AWS Elastic Beanstalk: https://api.getleery.com</li>
            <li>SSL achieved through Load Balancer configuration and redirect code employed through .ebextensions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
      <p class="comment">While Leery is indeed my pride and joy, I realize it is not perfect and am therefore constantly considering ways to improve it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Security</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Increased obfuscation on the Snippet code itself to avoid tampering</li>
            <li>Creation of more unique User ID’s to prevent theft of the product</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>Functionality</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the User App, ability to delete Messages</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>Miscellaneous</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the User App, the signup page should not submit if the front-end validation fails</li>
            <li>In the User App API routes, instead of checking if a Message exists and then determining whether to create or edit a Message, use an upsert function</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Team</h3>
      <p class="comment">The Product Manager mainly played a part-time role helping to guide the development process and review code, while I worked on all other aspects of Leery as a full-time endeavor.</p>

        <li><p>Product Manager: Marshall Guttenberg</p>
          <ul>
